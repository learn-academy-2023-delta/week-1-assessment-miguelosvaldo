# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statements is procedure to compare arguments to see if they are true or false. 

Researched answer: Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. 

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git runs locally, or in a computer that is being in use to modify files and code, while Github is the cloud version of that. And unlike git, in Github other programmers can access code from other programmers.

Researched answer: While Git is a tool that's used to manage multiple versions of source code edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The greater than or less than operator will return a Boolean answer.

Researched answer: The logical AND, Logical OR, and Logical ! will return a Boolean in Javascript.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The Index of an array show the current position, while the value show the value of the element in the array.

Researched answer: An array is an indexed collection of data elements of the same type. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Both can contain a value. Both are indexed. Although string index can start at 1, array index starts at 0. 

Researched answer: Strings are similar to arrays with just a few differences. Usually, the array size is fixed, while strings can have a variable number of elements. Arrays can contain any data type (char short int even other arrays) while strings are usually ASCII characters terminated with a NULL (0) character.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The two roles are the driver and the navigator. While both can pitch in the code. The navigator reads inctructions, initiates the code and orally codes to the driver. The driver performs the code provided by the navigator into the computer.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: From what I understood, it is the practice of using functions as variable, and/ or parameters. 

2. Jest: Jest is a  framework that provides assistance with the testing of code.

3. Objects: Objects are other forms of data types in Javascript. Composed of keys and values.

4. Method: Method is considered another form of a function, but the difference is that a method can work with objects, while functions can not.

5. Classes: Classes are tied to objects and act as a blue print of an object that is being created.
